#Hing Link
hing link is some sort of link that connects two nodes to each other, but only connect their Dx, Dy, Dz together not rotations of them.
Limitation is that both nodes should have same location.
Using this sort of link, it is possible to model end release in Shells, etc.

#Obsolete
use spring1d at the moment to connect nodes like hinged (but no rigid!)
